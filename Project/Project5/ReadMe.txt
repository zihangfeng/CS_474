When opening the project, user as usual should cbp file that opens everything in the project. If user only open the main file, it won't and an error message will be displayed. The project does not function the way it should be. I try very hard to generate everything alone the path to the completion of the proejct. There are things I can't handle probably. However, I did created the three type of food and description associate to the item.
